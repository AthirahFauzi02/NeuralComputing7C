# NeuralComputing7C
Dear Dr Shahreeza👨‍💻,

This is our repo for Assignment 7C.

🤖So, basically our project is about game generator in which we integrate both gpt4all and stable diffusion v2.1.

🤖For gpt4all model, we decided to go for "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin" and it is used to generate idea on the character of the game, background wallpaper of the game and obstacles of the game.

🤖Then, the output from gpt4all will be the prompt in stable diffusion to generate images for the game. For stable diffusion we used "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1".

🤖The images generated by the stable diffusion will be integrated in the game.

🤖For the game we decided to choose a simple game which inspired by Flappy Bird game.

Due to the Pygame library that cannot run in Google Colab and also insufficient GPU in our laptop, we had to lend our friend's desktop and use team viewer (because he is far away) to run the gpt4all, stable diffusion and pygame in VSCode.

This repo is the only way that we can show you our work, effort and creativity💻 This might not be the best idea, but we hope you like it🫶.

If you wish to run our code, you can directly download the zip file and run in Jupyter in VSCode and run the main.py file.

Here's we include the output that we got so far from the game generator:
